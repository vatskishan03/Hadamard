# Attack notes: structure, obstructions and new searches

Working notes for the push on the unresolved orders in [FRONTIER.md](../FRONTIER.md).
Everything here is either proved below, or measured with the code in this directory.

## 1. The bottleneck is the coarse characters

For a group-developed construction over an abelian group G, write X_i(χ) for the
character sums of the four sequences. The Goethals–Seidel condition is

    Σ_i |X_i(χ)|² = 4|G|   for every nontrivial character χ,

and Σ_i X_i(1)² = 4|G| (the row sums). If the sequences are constant on the orbits
of H ≤ Aut(G), then X_i(χ) = Σ_O y_O η_O(χ) with periods η_O(χ) = Σ_{g∈O} χ(g).

Call a character *coarse* when its periods are rational integers with large
common factors, as with the trivial character (η_O = |O|) and characters of order
2. For a coarse character the condition is a four-squares equation in integers
that are fixed modulo the orbit sizes. That forces orbit sizes ≲ √|G|, and so at
least about √|G| orbits.

Over ℤ_p this is the √p bound of METHOD.md. Section 3 shows that the same
mechanism reappears in every variant tried here.

## 2. Cost scaling

With k ≈ 2C orbits, C classes, per-class standard deviation σ_c of the class
values, and pools N ≈ 2^k/σ_r, the model in search/triage.py gives
E ≈ N⁴ Π p_c with p_c ≈ 0.8/σ_c. The k-tree work per solution with lists of
size L is

    W ≈ N³/(E L) = 1/(N Π_c p_c L) ≈ (σ_r / L) · Π_c (σ_c / 3.2).

For σ_c ≈ √|G| this is (√|G|/3.2)^C · σ_r/L, exponential in C. The minimum
possible C is about √|G|/2. An order is cheap exactly when its group admits
symmetry with orbits of size about √|G| and an admissible row-sum pattern, as in
the m² + m + 1 family. For prime p this is a property of the divisors of p − 1.

## 3. Variants that do not escape the bound

### 3.1 Spence's construction and the slice character (FRONTIER correction)

Take G = ℤ₂ × K with |K| odd, and H acting on K. The character χ(z, k) = (−1)^z
has X_i(χ) = a_i − b_i, the difference of the two slice sums. The Spence
condition Σ_i |X_i(χ)|² = 4n with a_i + b_i = r_i = (2, 0, 0, 0) becomes

    (a₁ − 1)² + a₂² + a₃² + a₄² = n.

Each a_i is a signed sum of K-orbit sizes, so a_i ≡ ±1 (mod 2h) when all
nontrivial orbits have size h. This is again a √n bound, on K, which has half the
order. Spence structures therefore need about 2√n orbits, twice as many as
Goethals–Seidel over ℤ_n. The triage behind FRONTIER.md omits this condition.

Measured (`calibrate.py`, `count4.c`):

| structure | Gaussian model | exact count |
|---|---:|---:|
| ℤ₂ × ℤ₅², \|H\| = 3 | 10^9.5 | 10^10.5 |
| ℤ₂ × ℤ₁₁², \|H\| = 15 | 10^4.1 | 0 |
| ℤ₂ × ℤ₁₃², \|H\| = 21 | 10^2.9 | 0 |

In both zero cases the slice equation has no solution. `spence_slice_check.py`
checks every multiplier subgroup for each FRONTIER Spence entry:

- 3356 (ℤ₂ × ℤ₄₁₉, listed at log W 15.0) has no admissible structure with ≤ 400 orbits.
- 8828 and 11420 have no admissible structure with ≤ 400 orbits.
- 4748 (listed at 15.2) is admissible only with |H| = 8 and 150 orbits.

The cheapest feasible entry of the table is therefore 4412 (Goethals–Seidel, 10^15.5).

### 3.2 Full automorphism groups (Singer cycles) on elementary-abelian parts

In characteristic 2, orbits of Singer subgroups that lie in a subfield are
subspaces. For example, with H of order 3 on ℤ₂⁴ the orbits are the lines of a
spread, and every Walsh coefficient collapses to Ŵ(a) = c₀ + 4u_{O(a)}. On
ℤ₂⁴ × ℤ₃ the model predicts 10^7.15 solutions. Exact enumeration (`count_exact.py`,
68 s) finds 0. In odd characteristic the slice constraint of 3.1 applies.

### 3.3 Non-cyclic groups for Goethals–Seidel

The only open order with a non-cyclic group of order n is n = 1719 = 3² · 191
(`gs_1719.py`). On ℤ₃² × ℤ₁₉₁ the shifts inside ℤ₃² see whole ℤ₁₉₁-orbits, so
their class values move in steps of the orbit size, and the row sums fix the
residues. Every structure fails this lattice test except two, and those have
log E ≈ −30.

### 3.4 An 8-block Goethals–Seidel array

A ratio-16 construction over an odd group with a border would remove every real
character. `gs_array_gf2.py` reduces the existence of a Goethals–Seidel-type
realization (entries ±X, ±Xᵀ, ±XR, ±XᵀR) of an orthogonal design to a linear
system over GF(2):

- OD(4; 1,1,1,1) is solvable. This is the Goethals–Seidel array.
- OD(8; 1⁸) is inconsistent: 336 equations, rank 105.

### 3.5 Central elements of non-abelian groups

Class functions commute, so the Goethals–Seidel array works for them. For
G = ℤ_q ⋊ ℤ_r the conjugacy classes outside ℤ_q have size q, and the linear
characters then force (a_i + 2q ε_i)² and (a_i − q ε_i)² to both sum to 4n. This
is impossible since |a_i| ≤ q.

## 4. What is left: small structures and Legendre pairs

- The FRONTIER table lists only structures with E ≥ 10, and the exhaustive pass
  in METHOD.md stopped at 18 cosets. Re-running triage.py over all open orders
  with 8–70 orbits turns up small-pool Goethals–Seidel structures with
  E ≈ 10^−1 to 10^−5. These are lottery tickets that can be searched exhaustively
  (`find4.c`, `gs_exhaustive.py`, validated by constructing H(148) and H(172)).
  The best is n = 933 (order 3732), |H| = 62, 22 orbits, E ≈ 10^−0.9.
- Legendre pairs (ℓ = 2n − 1) have no coarse character except the trivial one,
  and the border absorbs it. They are 2-list problems, linear in the pool. The
  repository never searched them. `lp_search.py` recovers the classical pairs and
  many others for prime ℓ. For composite ℓ, the only case open orders produce,
  small-structure pairs are rare.
