# Attack notes: structure, obstructions and new searches

Working notes for the push on the unresolved orders in [FRONTIER.md](../FRONTIER.md).
Everything here is either proved below, or measured with the code in this directory.

## 1. The bottleneck is the coarse characters

For a group-developed construction over an abelian group G, write X_i(χ) for the
character sums of the four sequences. The Goethals–Seidel condition is

    Σ_i |X_i(χ)|² = 4|G|   for every nontrivial character χ,

and Σ_i X_i(1)² = 4|G| (the row sums). If the sequences are constant on the orbits
of H ≤ Aut(G), then X_i(χ) = Σ_O y_O η_O(χ) with periods η_O(χ) = Σ_{g∈O} χ(g).

Call a character *coarse* when its periods are rational integers with large
common factors, as with the trivial character (η_O = |O|) and characters of order
2. For a coarse character the condition is a four-squares equation in integers
that are fixed modulo the orbit sizes. That forces orbit sizes ≲ √|G|, and so at
least about √|G| orbits.

Over ℤ_p this is the √p bound of METHOD.md. Section 3 shows that the same
mechanism reappears in every variant tried here.

## 2. Cost scaling

With k ≈ 2C orbits, C classes, per-class standard deviation σ_c of the class
values, and pools N ≈ 2^k/σ_r, the model in search/triage.py gives
E ≈ N⁴ Π p_c with p_c ≈ 0.8/σ_c. The k-tree work per solution with lists of
size L is

    W ≈ N³/(E L) = 1/(N Π_c p_c L) ≈ (σ_r / L) · Π_c (σ_c / 3.2).

For σ_c ≈ √|G| this is (√|G|/3.2)^C · σ_r/L, exponential in C. The minimum
possible C is about √|G|/2. An order is cheap exactly when its group admits
symmetry with orbits of size about √|G| and an admissible row-sum pattern, as in
the m² + m + 1 family. For prime p this is a property of the divisors of p − 1.

## 3. Variants that do not escape the bound

### 3.1 Spence's construction and the slice character (FRONTIER correction)

Take G = ℤ₂ × K with |K| odd, and H acting on K. The character χ(z, k) = (−1)^z
has X_i(χ) = a_i − b_i, the difference of the two slice sums. The Spence
condition Σ_i |X_i(χ)|² = 4n with a_i + b_i = r_i = (2, 0, 0, 0) becomes

    (a₁ − 1)² + a₂² + a₃² + a₄² = n.

Each a_i is a signed sum of K-orbit sizes, so a_i ≡ ±1 (mod 2h) when all
nontrivial orbits have size h. This is again a √n bound, on K, which has half the
order. Spence structures therefore need about 2√n orbits, twice as many as
Goethals–Seidel over ℤ_n. The triage behind FRONTIER.md omits this condition.

Measured (`calibrate.py`, `count4.c`):

| structure | Gaussian model | exact count |
|---|---:|---:|
| ℤ₂ × ℤ₅², \|H\| = 3 | 10^9.5 | 10^10.5 |
| ℤ₂ × ℤ₁₁², \|H\| = 15 | 10^4.1 | 0 |
| ℤ₂ × ℤ₁₃², \|H\| = 21 | 10^2.9 | 0 |

In both zero cases the slice equation has no solution. `spence_slice_check.py`
checks every multiplier subgroup for each FRONTIER Spence entry:

- 3356 (ℤ₂ × ℤ₄₁₉, listed at log W 15.0) has no admissible structure with ≤ 400 orbits.
- 8828 and 11420 have no admissible structure with ≤ 400 orbits.
- 4748 (listed at 15.2) is admissible only with |H| = 8 and 150 orbits.

The cheapest feasible entry of the table is therefore 4412 (Goethals–Seidel, 10^15.5).

### 3.2 Full automorphism groups (Singer cycles) on elementary-abelian parts

In characteristic 2, orbits of Singer subgroups that lie in a subfield are
subspaces. For example, with H of order 3 on ℤ₂⁴ the orbits are the lines of a
spread, and every Walsh coefficient collapses to Ŵ(a) = c₀ + 4u_{O(a)}. On
ℤ₂⁴ × ℤ₃ the model predicts 10^7.15 solutions. Exact enumeration (`count_exact.py`,
68 s) finds 0. In odd characteristic the slice constraint of 3.1 applies.

### 3.3 Non-cyclic groups for Goethals–Seidel

The only open order with a non-cyclic group of order n is n = 1719 = 3² · 191
(`gs_1719.py`). On ℤ₃² × ℤ₁₉₁ the shifts inside ℤ₃² see whole ℤ₁₉₁-orbits, so
their class values move in steps of the orbit size, and the row sums fix the
residues. Every structure fails this lattice test except two, and those have
log E ≈ −30.

### 3.4 An 8-block Goethals–Seidel array

A ratio-16 construction over an odd group with a border would remove every real
character. `gs_array_gf2.py` reduces the existence of a Goethals–Seidel-type
realization (entries ±X, ±Xᵀ, ±XR, ±XᵀR) of an orthogonal design to a linear
system over GF(2):

- OD(4; 1,1,1,1) is solvable. This is the Goethals–Seidel array.
- OD(8; 1⁸) is inconsistent: 336 equations, rank 105.

### 3.5 Central elements of non-abelian groups

Class functions commute, so the Goethals–Seidel array works for them. For
G = ℤ_q ⋊ ℤ_r the conjugacy classes outside ℤ_q have size q, and the linear
characters then force (a_i + 2q ε_i)² and (a_i − q ε_i)² to both sum to 4n. This
is impossible since |a_i| ≤ q.

## 4. What is left: small structures and Legendre pairs

- The FRONTIER table lists only structures with E ≥ 10, and the exhaustive pass
  in METHOD.md stopped at 18 cosets. Re-running triage.py over all open orders
  with 8–70 orbits turns up small-pool Goethals–Seidel structures with
  E ≈ 10^−1 to 10^−5. These are lottery tickets that can be searched exhaustively
  (`find4.c`, `gs_exhaustive.py`, validated by constructing H(148) and H(172)).
  The best is n = 933 (order 3732), |H| = 62, 22 orbits, E ≈ 10^−0.9.
- Legendre pairs (ℓ = 2n − 1) have no coarse character except the trivial one,
  and the border absorbs it. They are 2-list problems, linear in the pool. The
  repository never searched them. `lp_search.py` recovers the classical pairs and
  many others for prime ℓ. For composite ℓ, the only case open orders produce,
  small-structure pairs are rare.

## 5. Results of the lottery searches

All searches below are exhaustive (`gs_exhaustive.py`, `find4b.c`). Each verified
solution would have been rebuilt and checked as a Hadamard matrix.

| n | \|H\| | orbits | classes | pattern | pools | pairs | log₁₀ E (Gaussian) | solutions |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 933 | 62 | 22 | 11 | (1,1,3,61) | 1.16·10⁵ ×3, 1.12·10⁵ | 2.7·10¹⁰ | −0.9 | 0 |
| 1981 | 141 | 21 | 10 | (1,1,1,89) | 4.0·10⁴ ×3, 1.9·10⁴ | 2.4·10⁹ | −3.2 | 0 |

`lottery_rank.py 4 40` ranks every Goethals–Seidel structure of every open order
with 4 to 40 orbits (−1 ∉ H). Eleven structures are admissible. Besides the two
above, the ones with log₁₀ E > −6 are:

| n | \|H\| | orbits | log₁₀ E | exhaustive pairs |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 933 | 31 | 33 | 0.3 | 2.8·10¹⁷ |
| 1893 | 90 | 30 | −3.1 | 1.3·10¹⁵ |
| 955 | 38 | 33 | −3.1 | 3.1·10¹⁶ |
| 2973 | 110 | 38 | −4.6 | 6.5·10¹⁹ |
| 1255 | 50 | 33 | −5.0 | 6.3·10¹⁶ |

None of these is affordable here.

`spence_rank.py 44` does the same for Spence structures ℤ₂ × ℤ_m (n ≡ 3 mod 4)
that pass the slice condition of §3.1. There are 502 with at most 44 orbits.

| n | \|H\| | orbits | pairs | log₁₀ E |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 599 | 33 | 30 | 1.9·10¹⁴ | −6.8 |
| 947 | 35 | 42 | 1.7·10²¹ | −8.4 |
| 647 | 24 | 36 | 7.7·10¹⁷ | −10.5 |

Every other structure is below 10⁻¹¹. METHOD.md reports that the Gaussian model
for Spence can be off by a factor of 100, which does not change the conclusion. So
neither small Goethals–Seidel nor small Spence structures leave a useful lottery
ticket. The only exception is n = 933 with |H| = 31, which has about two expected
solutions but needs about 10¹⁷ pair operations.

## 6. Cooper–Wallis routes: T-matrices for the open orders

FRONTIER.md lists Goethals–Seidel and Spence structures only. Every composite
open n = t·w with w a Williamson order (w ≤ 63) has t ≥ 167. So these routes need
T-matrices of a prime order t ≥ 167:

- T(179) would give 2148, 7876 and 9308.
- T(191) would give 2292, 3820, 6876 and 11460. 9172 then follows by Miyamoto from 2292.
- T(223) would give 2676 (and through it 10708), 4460 and 11596.
- T(263) would give 3156, 5260, 7364 and 11572.

**Reformulation.** Put (A, B, C, D) = H₄ (T₁, T₂, T₃, T₄). T-matrices of order t
are exactly the Goethals–Seidel quadruples of length t with A·B·C·D ≡ 1
pointwise; the repository's T(97), T(103) and T(197) all satisfy this. With
E = AB = CD the condition becomes f_E(A) + f_E(C) = 0, where
f_E(X) = P_X + P_{XE}. For fixed E this is a 2-list self-join.

**Symmetric T-matrices.** With H ≤ ℤ_t* of order h, the block containing 0 has
row sum ±1 + hj and the other three have row sums hj, with Σ rᵢ² = t. For a d = 3
twist (T₁ invariant under K = ⟨H, μ⟩, and T₃, T₄ the images of T₂ under μ, μ²),
r₁² + 3r² = t. A K-orbit can either lie in T₁, or have T₂ on exactly one of its
three H-cosets, so each K-orbit has 8 states.

`tmat_scan.py` lists the admissible structures with at most 40 classes:

| route | n | t | structure | K-orbits | classes |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 7572 | 1893 = 3·631 | 631 | d = 3, \|H\| = 7, \|K\| = 21, rows (22; 7, 7, 7) | 30 | 15 |
| 9260 | 2315 = 5·463 | 463 | plain, h = 11, rows (10, 11, 11, 11) | 42 | 21 |
| 5020 | 1255 = 5·251 | 251 | plain, h = 5 | 50 | 25 |
| 3732 | 933 = 3·311 | 311 | plain, h = 5 | 62 | 31 |
| 2676, 4460, 11596 | 669, 1115, 2899 | 223 | plain, h = 3 | 74 | 37 |

Structures that are dead:

- T(179) and T(263): (t − 1)/2 is prime, so ℤ_t* has no useful subgroup.
- T(191): every subgroup, plain or twisted, fails the row-sum equation.

For T(631) with the d = 3 structure, `tmat_t3_model.py` predicts 10^4.7
solutions, most with 5 to 9 K-orbits in T₁. This is the only route among the open
orders with 15 classes and a large E. But it couples the blocks:

- Once the 30 K-orbit types are fixed, only two independent sign lists remain, T₁
  and the μ-orbit of T₂.
- In Goethals–Seidel form (A, B, μB, μ²B), the condition A = B·B^μ·B^{μ²} makes it
  a 1-list problem.

The best split (k₁ = 15, fixed types with parity, a 2-list join over the signs)
costs about 10^13.6 operations per solution. This is no better than the d = 3
structure over ℤ₁₈₉₃ in METHOD.md (10^14.7).

## 7. Other routes checked

- **Recursive constructions.** Yamada (J. Austral. Math. Soc. 1989) gives
  H(4(q + 2)) for a prime power q = n − 2:
  - from a skew-Hadamard matrix of order (q + 3)/2 when q ≡ 5 (mod 8), a result
    credited to Kiyasu;
  - from a symmetric conference matrix of order (q + 3)/2 when q ≡ 1 (mod 8).
  
  For the open orders:
  - The skew orders needed are 940, 1108 and 1192 (through 596). All three are
    unknown in Cati–Pasechnik (n = 235, 277, 149). ℤ₁₄₉ and ℤ₂₇₇ have no
    multiplier structure for a skew first block.
  - The conference route needs (n − 1)/2 to be a sum of two squares. This holds
    only for n = 955, which needs a symmetric conference matrix of order 478, that
    is a conference graph on 477 = 3²·53 vertices. Abelian Paley partial difference
    sets need a prime power order, or 9m⁴ or m⁴, so no Cayley construction exists.
- **Legendre pairs** (ℓ = 2n − 1, H(2ℓ + 2) = H(4n)). Two ±1 sequences give 2ℓ
  signs against (ℓ − 1)/2 equations, so 4 signs per equation instead of the 8 of
  Goethals–Seidel. Each equation P_A(s) + P_B(s) = −2 has spread about √(2ℓ) on a
  lattice of spacing 4. The Gaussian count is then about
  [4·(1.13/√ℓ)^{1/2}]^{(ℓ−1)/h} for a structure with orbits of size h, and the
  bracket is below 1 for ℓ > 326. Legendre pairs of length ℓ ≥ 1073, the smallest
  length an open order needs, can only come from algebraic structures (Paley, twin
  primes) or from a few orbits by luck. `lp_sweep.py 3 24` searches every
  multiplier structure with at most 24 orbits for every open n, exhaustively.
  Hits are written to `lp_hits.json`.
- **Projection methods.** The Elser RRR / difference-map iteration on
  A = {±1}^{4v}, B = {Σᵢ|X̂ᵢ(k)|² = 4v ∀k} (`dm/rrr_gs.py`) solves unstructured
  quadruples for v ≤ 21 in about 10⁴ iterations, but none for v = 23 to 31 in
  5·10⁵. The symmetric version stays in the H-invariant subspace exactly, since
  X(hk) = X(k) (`dm/rrr_orb.py`). It fails in 2·10⁵ iterations on the order-4492
  structure (1123, |H| = 33), which the k-tree solves in seconds. Not competitive.
- **Limits on the number of lists.** Plug-in constructions (Cooper–Wallis,
  Baumert–Hall, orthogonal designs with circulant variables) give independent
  k-tree lists only through the variables of an orthogonal design of order 4m with
  m odd. By Radon–Hurwitz there are at most ρ(4m) = 4. Splitting a sequence into
  disjoint parts leaves bilinear cross terms, and T-matrix-type cancellation needs
  4 × m sign matrices M with MᵀM = 4I, so m ≤ 4. Four lists is the ceiling for
  orders 4·odd.
- **Schur rings.** Every Schur ring over ℤ_p is an orbit ring of a subgroup of ℤ_p*
  (Pöschel). So for prime n the only sequence families whose autocorrelations stay
  in a fixed proper subring are the multiplier structures, and the √p bound of
  METHOD.md covers all of them.
